/**
 * Represents a liquidity pool daily snapshot for Uniswap V2.

 * @param entryTime 
 * @param recvTime 
 * @param blockNumber Number of block in which entity was recorded.
 * @param blockRange .
 * @param id (smart contract address of the pool)-(# of days since Unix epoch time)
 * @param protocol The protocol this snapshot belongs to
 * @param pool The pool this snapshot belongs to
 * @param timestamp Timestamp of this snapshot
 * @param totalValueLockedUsd Current TVL (Total Value Locked) of this pool
 * @param cumulativeSupplySideRevenueUsd All revenue generated by the liquidity pool, accrued to the supply side.
 * @param dailySupplySideRevenueUsd Daily revenue generated by the liquidity pool, accrued to the supply side.
 * @param cumulativeProtocolSideRevenueUsd All revenue generated by the liquidity pool, accrued to the protocol.
 * @param dailyProtocolSideRevenueUsd Daily revenue generated by the liquidity pool, accrued to the protocol.
 * @param cumulativeTotalRevenueUsd All revenue generated by the liquidity pool.
 * @param dailyTotalRevenueUsd Daily revenue generated by the liquidity pool.
 * @param dailyVolumeUsd All trade volume occurred in a given day, in USD.
 * @param dailyVolumeByTokenAmount All trade volume occurred in a given day for a specific input token, in native amount. The ordering should be the same as the pool's `inputTokens` field.
 * @param dailyVolumeByTokenUsd All trade volume occurred in a given day for a specific input token, in USD. The ordering should be the same as the pool's `inputTokens` field..
 * @param cumulativeVolumeUsd All historical trade volume occurred in this pool, in USD.
 * @param inputTokenBalances Amount of input tokens in the pool. The ordering should be the same as the pool's `inputTokens` field.
 * @param inputTokenWeights Weights of input tokens in the liquidity pool in percentage values. For example, 50/50 for Uniswap pools, 48.2/51.8 for a Curve pool, 10/10/80 for a Balancer pool.
 * @param outputTokenSupply Total supply of output token. Note that certain DEXes don't have an output token (e.g. Bancor).
 * @param outputTokenPriceUsd Price per share of output token in USD.
 * @param stakedOutputTokenAmount Total supply of output tokens that are staked (usually in the MasterChef contract). Used to calculate reward APY..
 * @param rewardTokenEmissionsAmount Per-block reward token emission as of the current block normalized to a day, in token's native amount. This should be ideally calculated as the theoretical rate instead of the realized amount.
 * @param rewardTokenEmissionsUsd Per-block reward token emission as of the current block normalized to a day, in USD value. This should be ideally calculated as the theoretical rate instead of the realized amount.
