 * Represents a liquidity pool daily snapshot for Uniswap V3.
 *
 * @param entryTime 
 * @param recvTime 
 * @param blockNumber Number of block in which entity was recorded.
 * @param vid .
 * @param block The Ethereum block number associated with the liquidity pool daily snapshot.

 * @param day Number of days since Unix epoch time.
 * @param protocol Protocol associated with the liquidity pool.
 * @param pool Pool this snapshot belongs to.
 * @param tick Current tick representing the price of token0/token1.
 * @param totalValueLockedUsd Current TVL (Total Value Locked) of this pool.
 * @param totalLiquidity The sum of all active and non-active liquidity for this pool.
 * @param totalLiquidityUsd Sum of all active and non-active liquidity in USD for this pool.
 * @param activeLiquidity All liquidity `k` that is active. Will be equal to totalLiquidity except for in concentrated liquidity - where activeLiquidity is all liquidity positions that contain the pools current tick.
 * @param activeLiquidityUsd All liquidity in USD that is active. Will be equal to totalLiquidity except for in concentrated liquidity - where activeLiquidity is all liquidity positions that contain the pools current tick.
 * @param uncollectedProtocolSideTokenAmounts All protocol-side value locked in token amounts that remains uncollected and unused in the pool.
 * @param uncollectedProtocolSideValuesUsd All protocol-side value locking in USD that remains uncollected and unused in the pool.
 * @param uncollectedSupplySideTokenAmounts All supply-side value locked in token amounts that remains uncollected and unused in the pool.
 * @param uncollectedSupplySideValuesUsd All supply-side value locked in USD that remains uncollected and unused in the pool.
 * @param cumulativeSupplySideRevenueUsd All revenue generated by the liquidity pool, accrued to the supply side.

 * @param cumulativeVolumeUsd All historical trade volume occurred in this pool, in USD.
 * @param dailyVolumeUsd All trade volume occurred in a given day, in USD.
 * @param cumulativeVolumeByTokenAmount All trade volume , in native amount. The ordering should be the same as the pool's `inputTokens` field.
 * @param dailyVolumeByTokenAmount All trade volume occurred in a given day for a specific input token, in native amount. The ordering should be the same as the pool's `inputTokens` field.
 * @param cumulativeVolumeByTokenUsd All trade volume, in USD. The ordering should be the same as the pool's `inputTokens` field.
 * @param dailyVolumeByTokenUsd  All trade volume occurred in a given day for a specific input token, in USD. The ordering should be the same as the pool's `inputTokens` field.
 * @param inputTokenBalances Amount of input tokens in the pool. The ordering should be the same as the pool's `inputTokens` field.
 * @param inputTokenBalancesUsd Amount of input tokens in USD in the pool. The ordering should be the same as the pool's `inputTokens` field.
 * @param inputTokenWeights Weights of input tokens in the liquidity pool in percentage values. For example, 50/50 for Uniswap pools, 48.2/51.8 for a Curve pool, 10/10/80 for a Balancer pool.
 * @param stakedOutputTokenAmount Total supply of output tokens that are staked (usually in the MasterChef contract). Used to calculate reward APY.
 * @param rewardTokenEmissionsAmount Per-block reward token emission as of the current block normalized to a day, in token's native amount. This should be ideally calculated as the theoretical rate instead of the realized amount.
 * @param rewardTokenEmissionsUsd Per-block reward token emission as of the current block normalized to a day, in USD value. This should be ideally calculated as the theoretical rate instead of the realized amount.
 * @param cumulativeDepositCount Total number of deposits (add liquidity).
